# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

`original.py` on each day is my as-fast-as-possible solution to the problem, with only minor cleanup.

Some interesting notes:
- I ended up golfing [Day 1: Inverse Captcha](day01/golf.py) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1))
- I'm fond of my solution for [Day 21: Fractal Art](day21/original.py) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/21))

I placed [ninth overall](https://adventofcode.com/2017/leaderboard), missing eighth by _one point_ ðŸ˜©
