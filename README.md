# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018).

`original.py` on each day is my as-fast-as-possible solution to the problem, with only minor cleanup.

Some interesting notes:
- My solution to Day 21: Chronal Conversion ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/21)) isn't particularly special, but I want to shout out that I'm an enormous fan of that puzzle in particular
- I'm particularly proud of my binary search-ish solution to [Day 23: Experimental Emergency Teleportation](day23/original.py) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/23))

I ended up placing [24th overall](https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard).
