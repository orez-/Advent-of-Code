# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016).

The solutions in `original.py` for each day are an only-slightly edited version of my original, as-fast-as-possible solution to the problem.
This year I attempted to clean up each solution into a supplemental `main.py`, to demonstrate that I'm also capable of writing code that isn't a haphazard mess.
I didn't end up following through with this for all of my solutions.

I ended up placing [fourth overall](https://adventofcode.com/2016/leaderboard)!
