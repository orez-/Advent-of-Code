# Advent of Code 2015

Some of my solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015).

This was the first year of Advent of Code, my first year solving it.
This project predates me actually collecting my code in a manner that's in any way presentable.
As such, days 1 to 5 and 8 are missing and most of the code only solves either part 1 or part 2, with the other part existing commented out.
Also for some reason, rather than having my solutions read from an input file a lot of them require you to manually pipe in the input file, eg `cat input.txt | python2 day12.py`.

I believe all the python code is python 2.

Fun interesting note: my original solution for [Day 11: Corporate Policy](day11) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/11)) was in Ruby!
Look at me.

I hit the ground running even for this first year: I solved the first problem on the same day it was released.
However, I only started staying up for the midnight release consistently on Day 13.
Despite this, I ended up placing [42nd overall](https://adventofcode.com/2015/leaderboard).
