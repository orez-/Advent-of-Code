# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019).

`original.py` on each day is my as-fast-as-possible solution to the problem, with only minor cleanup.

Many puzzles this year made use of a scripting language called Intcode.
The specifications for an Intcode interpreter were provided over the following days:
- [Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm](day02) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2))
- [Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](day05) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5))
- [Day 9: Sensor Boost](day09) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9))

Every odd day starting with day 5 made use of this Intcode interpreter as a black-box executable.

Some interesting notes:
- My favorite puzzle this year was probably [Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation](day18) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/18)).
  It was a tough one that leaned way into the "easy to implement an MVP, tough to make run fast" genre of puzzle, which I'm a big fan of.
- Although I didn't really appreciate it as a puzzle for Advent of Code at the time, [Day 22: Slam Shuffle](day22) ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22)) was a very interesting change of pace that forced me to learn more about modular arithmetic.

I ended up tying for [31st overall](https://adventofcode.com/2019/leaderboard).
