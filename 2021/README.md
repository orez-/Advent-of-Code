# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021).

In previous years I competed to complete puzzles as fast as possible.
In 2021 instead of racing the clock, I'm challenging myself to solve each problem with a different programming language, where each language name starts with a different letter of the alphabet.
Most of these languages are new to me--part of the challenge is getting up to speed on each one.
In addition I'm trying to write the code as idiomatically for each language as possible.
I could probably muddle through each of these with simple C-like code, but I want to spend some time exploring what unique quality each language has to offer.
