## Retrospective

Good warm up.
I resisted the urge to overcomplicate it and got the simple solution up pretty quickly, in my opinion.
Parsed the question quickly, no stupid mistakes, got the right answer first try.
Unfortunately the Advent of Code site went down, so no placements today ☹️.
Placing on day 1 is a crapshoot anyway.
If something had to go wrong better it be today than any other.
