# Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

## Problem Summary ([?](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3))

This puzzle's input contains a terrain grid for a mountain, where each square is either open field or a tree.
The mountain terrain loops horizontally.
You are riding a sled down the mountain, and asked how many trees you encounter.

**Part 1** asks how many trees are encountered at a slope of right 3, down 1.
The answer for my input is 268.

**Part 2** asks how many trees are encountered at slopes 1,1; 3,1; 5,1; 7,1; and 1,2.
The result is the product of these values.
The answer for my input is 3093068400.


## Retrospective

Didn't place, but not so bad.
Part 1 I accidentally moved the three squares right on the first line instead of after it.
Figured out my issue pretty quickly but definitely lost some time there.
Part 2 came together with no problems, but I felt like I got it pretty slowly.
The resulting code was pretty hideous too.
Spent some time putting together a less ugly solution after the fact as well.
